Learning and practicing using Laravel from zero.

Web Server : Apache(within XAMPP)

<h4>Installation : </h4>
Including Composer(Dependency Manager for PHP), Laravel.

<h5>Composer : </h5>

<h5>Laravel : </h5>
Download source from <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel/archive/master.zip">Github Repository</a>
Decompress it into your project, 
and then use command line to go into the directory and to execute the instruction <code>composer install</code> to begin downloading and installing.

After finishing installation, we can have a look at the directory structure of app :
<pre>
app
  |-commands
  |-configs
  |-controllers

  |-views
  |-filters.php
  |-routes.php
</pre>
